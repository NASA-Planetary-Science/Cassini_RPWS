Trigger 28 (Interplanetary Cruise with Direction-Finding)

     This mode is designed to provide a low bit-rate Survey with low temporal
and spectral resolution for periods during cruise. No Wideband or Waveform
measurements are made. The entire RPWS frequency range (1 Hz - 16 MHz) is covered.


Receiver      Frequency Range	      Sensors	      Time between Snapshots
--------      ----------------        -------         ----------------------
  LFR	         1 - 25 Hz	      EX, BX		  32 seconds
  MFR	        25 - 12 KHz	      EX, BZ		  32 seconds
  HFR	      3.6 KHz - 16 MHz	        E		  64 seconds

The HFR is in direction-finding mode for the frequency range from 3.6 KHz to 2 MHz.
Thus, measurements are made on all three monopoles EU, EV and EW. For higher
frequencies only EX and EW are used.

This mode is defined by:

          Correlations     Channels        Integ.                Size Frequency
Band Ant. Auto-  Cross-    per Band   df   Period    Rep   Steps kHz  Start - Stop
---- ---- -----  ------    --------   --   ------    ---   ----- ---- ------------
ABC  2E   y         y        16       y    1000      1                3.6-319 kHz
H1   2E   y         y         1       y    160       1     18    100  325k-2.0MHz
H2   2E   y         y         1       n    80        1     71    200  2.0M-16MHz

Bands ABC require 6.40 sec to complete, H1 requires 6.07 sec, and H2 requires 6.36 sec
for a total of 18.83 sec per sweep. However, to keep the bit rate down the HFR only
performs one complete sweep every 64 seconds.
