Trigger 5A (High Rate Cyclic Mode)

     This mode is designed to step through various RPWS high resolution observations
over periods of order 1 hour or longer.  Eight different high resolution modes are sampled for
periods of 3 to 9 minutes with one complete cycle taking 1 hour.  The cyclic repeats until it
is stopped by the issuance of a new trigger command, typically Trigger 80.  The targeted
average data rate (averaged over 1 hour) is 40 kbps, but the true, compressed data rate
realized is closer to 30.5 kbps although this is somewhat data dependent.

     Trigger 5A is essentially identical to Trigger 58, but with a higher targeted
