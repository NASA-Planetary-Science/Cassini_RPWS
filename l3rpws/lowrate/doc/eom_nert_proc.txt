Notes on accelerating processing for end of mission work.  Start with
the goal of 10-minute updates and increase from there.

1. Current kickoff schedule

   12 -> KP Work
	22 -> LRFC Patch in
	40 -> Push processing check
	45 -> Database patch in from push data
	55 -> LRFC interference run 

  New kickoff schedule
  

2. Keep push area clean, drops processing time for database patch in

   



3. Shortend Low-Rate PDS processing window

    rpws_lr_rtinf.ksh -> go back 2 days, not 7
	 rpws_lr_rtfc.ksh 
 
    timing:
	 
	     rpws_lr_rtfc.ksh    ->  1:47   (min:sec)
		  rpws_lr_rtinf.ksh   ->    41.8  (sec)
	     rpws_push_wpatch.sh ->     2.9  (sec)
