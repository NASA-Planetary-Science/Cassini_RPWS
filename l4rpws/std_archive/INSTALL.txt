Prerequistes
============

This python module depends on the python package rpw_pds, which can be found
in SVN at:  

   https://saturn.physics.uiowa.edu/svn/rpws/python/trunk/rpwPDS

That package in turn depends on the "PDS Tools Package" at:

   http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/tools/software_download.cfm 


Running From Source
===================

This is a pure python module and my thus be run from the source tree without
installation.  If you'd like to do that, then add the module directory to your
PYTHONPATH and the scripts directory to your PATH.  The following commands
issued from the directory containing this file should do the trick.

  $ export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`:$PYTHONPATH
  $ export PATH=`pwd`/scripts:$PATH

This will insure that the versions here are picked up first.

NOTE: You could also use the dependency library rpw_pds in a similar manner
by adding it's top level directory rpwPDS (not rpw_pds) to your PYTHONPATH
as well. 


Installation
============

1. Run installation script.


  * To install in your home directory under $HOME/lib/python and $HOME/bin:
   
    $ python setup.py install --home=$HOME
      
    and set PYTHONPATH in your .bashrc or .kshrc.

    This will install files in: 
	 
	    $HOME/lib/python/rpw_cas
	
	 and will put the scripts caslen0HRfix, casmstrdvd, casseq_to_txt, and
    casvolreport in:
	 
	    $HOME/bin
	 

  * To install in the standard sys location:

    $ python setup.py install
   
    The standard system location varies but on unix it's usually
    /usr/local/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages or /usr/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages
    where X.X is your python major and minor versions.  On windows it is
    usually C:\PythonXX where XX is the python major and minor versions.

    On UNIX this will (typically) install files in:

       /usr/local/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages/rpw_cas
		 
	 and will put the scripts caslen0HRfix, casmstrdvd, casseq_to_txt, and
    casvolreport in:
	 
	    /usr/local/bin
   

2. If you are maintaining a personal stock of python libraries in your home
   directory, you should set PYTHONPATH in your login shell to point to that
   location, which is typically $HOME/lib/python.  This way all of your
   personal python libs will be found automatically when python is invoked.
