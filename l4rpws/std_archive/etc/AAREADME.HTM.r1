<P>This volume set contains the Cassini Orbiter Radio and Plasma Wave Science
standard data products from the entire mission, submitted to the Planetary
Data System (PDS). Every effort has been made to ensure that the data and
documentation are of the best possible quality. However, mistakes are
inevitable. The PPI Node of the PDS will maintain an online list of ERRATA
where errors and updates are documented. Should any user of this product find
an error on this volume, please report the error to the PPI Node so that the
finding can be made public. All users are encouraged to verify the
"correctness" of the data prior to submitting any publications or other work
based on these data. Users of these data are encouraged to acknowledge both
the PDS and the principal investigators of the instruments whose data are
used in analysis in all publications.</P>

<P>This volume set contains Cassini Orbiter RPWS data from the entire
mission. New data will be added on subsequent volumes as they become
available. This volume, CORPWS_%(vol-num)s, includes all available data files with
start times (SCET) in the interval %(scet-start)s through %(scet-through)s.</P>

<H3>KEY THINGS TO KNOW IN USING DATA ON THIS DISK:</H3>

<P>A web browser can be used to view all the data on this disk in the form
of Portable Network Graphics (PNG) files which are image files of
frequency-time spectrograms by clicking on <A href="BROWSE/BROWSE.HTM">
Graphical Data Browser Index</A> in AAREADME.HTM in the root directory
(this file).  The browse data under the <A href="BROWSE/">BROWSE</A>
directory consist of the "*.PNG" files.  Survey plots are
presented along with links to corresponding data files and their
PDS label files.</P>

<P>All data files are stored under the <A href="DATA">DATA</A> top-level
directory and are organized by data set and spacecraft event time.  The DATA
directory branches off into:</P>

<UL>
<LI><A href="DATA/ANCILLARY/">ANCILLARY</A>, containing instrument mode
and sequence information
(<A href="EXTRAS/SEQUENCE_INFO/INDEX.HTM">Hypertext version</A>)</LI>

<LI><A href="DATA/RPWS_WIDEBAND_FULL/">RPWS_WIDEBAND_FULL</A>, containing
high rate wideband (WBR) data</LI>
</UL>

<P>The data are stored in text (key parameters) or binary (all others)
files with labels and format descriptions included as separate files.
PDS labels are contained in associated "*.LBL" text files in the same
directories as the data files and shared descriptions of many of the data
structures are stored in "*.FMT" files in the <A href="LABEL/">LABEL</A>
top-level directory.</P>

<P>General information for this volume set is provided in PDS catalog files
located in the <A href="CATALOG/">CATALOG</A> directory.  The data sets
are documented in:</P>

Langmuir Probe and sounder, and wave-normal analysis results of plasma
waves.</P>

<P>Another related PDS product is the Cassini Magnetosphere and Plasma

<P>This DVD-R is the %(vol-ord-name)s volume of the CORPWS_0xxx set.  This volume,
CORPWS_%(vol-num)s, contains all available RPWS standard data products from the
spacecraft event time (SCET) interval %(scet-start)s through %(scet-through)s.
Volumes will be added as new data are archived.</P>

<HR>
<H2><A name="Volume_Format_Information">Volume Format Information</A></H2>
<HR>

<P>The disk is organized into a hierarchical directory structure.  The disk is
formatted according to a combination of ISO 9660, UDF, Rock Ridge (UNIX),
and Joliet (Microsoft) standards in order to accommodate users on a wide
variety of platforms.  This volume does not contain any Extended Attribute
Records (XAR).  Thus, VMS users may have some problems accessing files
on this volume.</P>

<HR>
<H2><A name="File_Formats">File Formats</A></H2>
<HR>

<P>The data files on this volume are ASCII text and binary files.  Browse data
are provided in Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format.  All data files are
described by detached PDS labels.  A detached label file has the same name as
the data file that it describes, but with the extension .LBL.  For example,
the file T1999227_HFR0.DAT is accompanied by the detached label file
T1999227_HFR0.LBL in the same directory.  File names within this archive
comply with the "27.3" convention for compliance with ISO 9660 Level 2
interchange requirements.</P>

<P>All documents, detached PDS labels, and HTML files are stream format
files, with a carriage return (ASCII 13) and a line feed character (ASCII 10)
at the end of the record.  This allows the files to be read by MacOS, DOS,
Windows, UNIX, and VMS operating systems.  UNIX system users may see an
unnecessary carriage return character (^M) at the end of each line.  Mac users
may see an unnecessary line feed character (^J) at the start of each
line.</P>

<P>ASCII tabular data files (.TAB) are formatted so that they may be read
directly into many database management systems (DBMS) or spreadsheet programs
on various computers.  All fields are of fixed length and are separated by
white space or commas.  Character fields are left justified, and numeric
fields are right justified.  The records are of fixed length, and the last two
bytes of each record contain the ASCII carriage return and line feed
characters.  This allows a table to be treated as a fixed length record file
on computers that support this file type and as a normal text file on other
computers.</P>

<P>The document, PDS label, and ASCII table files on this volume can be
viewed with a Web browser.  Note that to view these files, the browser may
need to be configured to recognize files with extensions of .CAT, .LBL, and
.TAB as text files.  Users with Web browsers also can navigate the disk via
the HTML file AAREADME.HTM in the disk's root directory and the HTML files in
the <A href="BROWSE/">BROWSE</A> directory.</P>

<P>PDS labels are object-oriented.  The object to which the label refers
(e.g., SERIES, TABLE, etc.) is denoted by a statement of the form:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
^object                 = location
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>in which the caret character (^, also called a pointer in this context)
indicates that the object starts at the given location.  For an object in the
same file as the label, the location is an integer representing the starting
record number or byte of the object (the first record/byte in the file is 1).
For an object located outside the label file, the location denotes the name
of the file containing the object, along with the starting record or byte
number. For example:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
^SPECTRAL_DENSITY_TABLE = ("T1999227_HFR0.DAT", 4)
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>indicates that the SPECTRAL_DENSITY_TABLE object begins at record 4
of the file T1999227_HFR0.DAT, in the same directory as the detached label
file.  Below is a list of the possible formats that use the ^object keyword.
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
^object = n
^object = n&lt;BYTES&gt;
^object = ("filename.ext",n)
^object = ("filename.ext",n&lt;BYTES&gt;)
</PRE>

where
<TABLE BORDER=0>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">n <TD>is the starting record or byte number of the object,
  counting from the beginning of the file (record 1,
  byte 1); default is record number.
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">&lt;BYTES&gt; <TD>indicates that number given is in units
  of bytes.
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">filename <TD>upper-case file name.
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">ext <TD>upper-case file extension.
</TABLE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In cases where many files of the same format or structure are present, the
structure description component is detached from the primary label.  This
minimizes repeating information which does not vary from file to file.  In
these cases, a format file (.FMT) contains the file structure information and
the base label (.LBL) describes the parameters which generally do vary from
file to file (number of records, file name, start/stop time, etc.).  When a
format file is used within the PDS label, the syntax is:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
^STRUCTURE              = filename
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Example:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
^STRUCTURE              = "LRFULL_TABLE.FMT"
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Syntactically, the contents of the format file can be inserted directly
into the base label such that the entire file contents replace the single
line ^STRUCTURE = filename.  Note that these shared format files are
collected in the top-level <A href="LABEL/">LABEL</A> directory
on this volume.</P>

<HR>
<H2><A name="Errata">Errata</A></H2>

<P>There is a file called <A href="ERRATA.TXT">ERRATA.TXT</A> found at the
