The original source and header locations for each subdirectory of this
directory are given below:

ana  <-- /home/raj/project/Cassini/src/ana/ana9.00/ana

         this version was chosen because the executable here had the same
			md5sum as the production version of ana located at:
			
			   /opt/project/cassini/bin
			
			That was in use as of 2008-04-22.


lib     <-- Stuff from /home/raj/project/Cassini/include and 
                       /home/raj/project/Cassini/src/lib
