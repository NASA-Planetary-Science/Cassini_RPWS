This software has been tested on Solaris 10.  Much of the code depends on 
Big-Endian (Most Significant Byte First) byte order and 32-bit pointer lengths
to operate correctly.  To install the software:


Build dependencies
------------------
This source depends on libraries under stable/GSE. Install those first using
the install.txt instructions in that location.


Setup your environment
----------------------
The following enviroment variables need to be set before building the software

PREFIX     The top level install directory
RPWS_DATA  The directory for minipacket 'R' and 'U' files.
PGPLOT_DIR The directory containing the PGPLOT font file grfont.dat

Here's an example setup for installation into ones home directory:

$ bash
$ export PGPLOT_DIR=/local/pgplot
$ export PREFIX=$HOME/cassini
$ export RPWS_DATA=$PREFIX/data
$ export RPWS_MPDB=$RPWS_DATA/database/Cassini.db


If you often build install to the same location, generate a file you can
'source' to get these settings.

Build the software
------------------
$ gmake


Install the software
--------------------
$ gmake install


Running the software
----------------
You will need to have PGPLOT_DIR in your environment when running rpws_ana.

$ export PGPLOT_DIR=/local/pgplot
$ rpws_ana
