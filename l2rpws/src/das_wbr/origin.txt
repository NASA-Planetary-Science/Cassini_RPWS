The source code for these two readers was copied in from:

  /home/tfa/cassini/wbr/spec
  
The original names of the readers in that area was: 

   new10k_V4.exe, new80k_V4.exe, wbrgain.exe

For the wbrgain.exe the source file wbrgain_new.c was selected
since it seemed to account for more issues that may come up in
the data.
