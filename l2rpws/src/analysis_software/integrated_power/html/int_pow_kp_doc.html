<br>
The integrated power calculation is done by using the RPWS Key Parameter (KP) data set.<br>
The KP data set consists of 1-day files with an somewhat low resolution<br>
representation of the RPWS electric field data: nominally 1 minute in time,<br>
and approximately 10 frequencies per decade, extending logarithmically from <br>
1 Hz to 16.1 MHz. There are 73 frequency bins in this data set, and for each<br>
frequency bin the value representing median Electric Field Spectral Density for<br>
the given time interval and the given frequency interval is given. This median is<br>
selected from all available electric sensors: EX, EU, EV, and EW.<br>

<br>
The integrated power calculation can be averaged over a specified delta-t,<br>
given in minutes. The smallest value for this averaging interval, 1 minute,<br>
results in the resolution of the browse data set. The calculation can be done<br>
for each interval specified by the "delta-t to slide average by"; this specifies<br>
the output time resolution. The time tags for the output give the start time of<br>
each averaging interval.<br>

<br>
A radial distance adjustment can be made to the calculation. A planet is chosen<br>
and a normalization radius value R, given in units of that planet's radius.<br>
Then the integrated power is multiplied by the factor d<sup>2</sup>/R<sup>2</sup>,<br>
where d is the distance of Cassini from the chosen planet in planet radii.<br>
For informational purposes, here are various measures in kilometers:<br>
